# Contributing to Metaswitch Tinder
## Did you find a bug?
Check the github issue list - if you don't see it already, open a new one. Be sure to include as much detail about the problem as you can.

## Want to contribute some code?
Great!

* Open a pull request - give it a useful name and description. Be sure to include "Fixes #<issue number>" if it addresses an open issue.
* Ensure that the CI passes.
* Ensure that your change works as intended on the review app that gets automatically deployed using the PR code on heroku. You can access it by clicking on the "View deployment" button in the PR (it will take a few minutes to appear).
    * There are sometimes subtle differences between testing locally and testing live - that's what the review app is for.

Feel free to comment on the PR if no one responds for more than 7 days (responses should typically come much sooner than that!).
